## Jam Duration:
3rd Nov 8 pm to 13th Nov 11:59 pm

## Background

The theme of the Game Jam was "Reverse" and our team decided that the best way to use this theme would be time manipulation. 
Our team (which we shall refer to as Mobius) consisted of five members. 
The entire brainstorming and communication was done through Discord. 
No physical meetings were held.

## Story

You play as a husband who gets a call from someone who offers to help you save your wife. Shortly after, she dies. Not knowing what to do, you accept the offer and are taken back in time.
The game starts here, where you find that there is something that wants to kill the wife to take over her body. That entity cannot directly harm her so she uses the things around her. 
You have to ensure that she survives for three minutes. If you make a mistake you can go back in time, but this comes at a cost.

## Controls

Standard W A S F for movement
Camera movement with a mouse
E to interact with certain items
G to drop any item you are holding
R to reverse time

## Codebase and assets

The codebase is written entirely from scratch. Most 3D models (including characters) are made by our designer. Some 3D assets have been taken from Sketchfab. Some sounds are taken from Pixabay. All credits will be updated below shortly.

## Future

This game will be worked on and fully released according to the original vision. All the free assets will be replaced by our own assets. We do not intend to sell the Jam version of the game in any way. To give it a shot, visit the Itch.io link:
